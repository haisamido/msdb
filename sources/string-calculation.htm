Why you might need to "calculate strings"
</B></CENTER>

<P> If all you will ever do is play a standard-sized <B>guitar</B> in the 
<B>standard tuning</B>, stringing your guitar is no problem - 
pre-packaged sets of guitar strings will do just fine.  If, 
you ever need or want to branch out, however, you would need to 
"calculate" the correct string depending on the <B>size</B> of your 
instrument, the <B>note</B> you want, and the <B>tension</B> you want.  
Here are some of the guitar-related areas you could find yourself 
exploring that would require strings not found in the regular set.  

<P> There are the early plucked string instruments: vihuela, Renaissance 
guitar, Renaissance lute, Baroque guitar, Baroque lute, plus more.  
Even if you're sure you're never going to own one of those instruments, 
you could get involved, anyhow.  For instance, I converted 
a <B>modern guitar</B> into a <B>Baroque guitar</B> (see my web page).  
Some of these instruments have additional bass strings, and I can 
envision the simple addition of second neck to a modern guitar for 
these extra basses.  

<P> Other eras produced guitar music requiring extra basses.  
For example, Napolean Coste wrote for a <B>7-string guitar</B> and 
Fernando Carulli wrote some music for a <B>10-string guitar</B>.  
A 7th string would give us access to the <B>Russian guitar</B> repertoire.  
(Reading the music would pose a problem, but nothing that couldn't 
be handled by <B>tablature</B>.)

<P> There is a wealth of chamber works written for the <B>terz guitar</B>, 
tuned a minor third (3 half-steps) higher than the regular guitar.  
The <B>capo</B> solution becomes unsatisfactory when the music starts going 
way up the fingerboard.  By the way, a terz guitar with the 3rd string 
tuned down a half-step could serve as a quasi-Renaissance treble lute.

<P> <B>Alternate tunings</B> that deviate more than slightly from the 
regular tuning are candidates for custom-selected strings.  In my web 
page on the subject, I point out that you can often shift the whole 
tuning up or down a half-step or so to keep the over-all tension about 
right, but there may be cases where some strings are still 
too far removed from their intended tension.  Examples that come to mind are 
tunings that call for a low C, and my proposed violin tuning with 
string 6 tuned up to G.  Of course you wouldn't change a string to 
play a single piece in an alternate tuning, but it could be 
worth your while if you had a collection of such pieces and an 
extra guitar.  

<P> Perhaps your guitar is larger or smaller than the 
standard guitar.  Maybe a child in your family or a student has a half- or 
three-quarter sized guitar.  What are the right strings for it?

<P> The first problem is that string makers who offer a complete range 
of gauges - usually for "lute strings" - are pretty hard to come by.  And 
when you find a dealer, the prices can be hard to swallow after having 
gotten used to the prices of pre-packaged sets.  But I'll let market forces 
work that one out.  When guitarists get enthused about the areas that 
require custom-selected strings, all that should change.

How to "calculate strings" - determining MPL
</B></CENTER>

<P> So how do you figure out what string(s) will do the job?  What is 
the relevant string measurement and how do you calculate it?  

<P> I've used the word <B>gauge</B> above, and we know that 
steel-string guitarists and lutenists select strings by gauge.  
The gauge is the diameter of the cross-section of the 
string.  The problem is: gauge is <I>not</I> a very useful parameter.  

<P> That should come as no surprise.  We know, for example, that our 
3rd string has a larger diameter than the 4th and 5th strings even 
though the 3rd is higher pitched.  The explanation, of course, is that 
the composition of the treble and bass strings are different.  

<P> If we take a look at the physical equation that describes 
a <B>vibrating string</B>, we see that the <B>frequency</B> depends 
on length, tension and <B>mass per unit length</B>.  If we use 
the following shorthand:
<PRE>

      TENS = tension 
      FREQ = frequency 
      LENG = length 
      MPL  = mass per unit length, 
and   sqrt = square root
</PRE>

<P> the fundamental relationship is:
<PRE>

     FREQ = sqrt(TENS/MPL)/LENG/2
</PRE>

<P> Solving for the thing we need to know:  
<PRE>

     MPL = 9800xTENS/FREQ/FREQ/LENG/LENG/4

where TENS is in kilograms (kg),
      FREQ is in cycles per second (cps),
      LENG is in meters (m), 
and   MPL is in grams per meter (g/m).  
</PRE>

<P> See footnote 1 if you're curious about where the 9800 came from.  

<P> Related formulas have been devised to calculate the string diameter, but
you need a different formula for every string composition (see footnote 2.)  
The beauty of our formula above is that it works for any type of string 
imaginable - nylon monofilament, wound, gut, steel, 
graphite-impregnated horse-hair, rubber bands . . . you-name-it.  Just plug 
in your string length, the frequency of the note you want and the desired 
tension, and out pops the required mass per unit length.  

<P> But who the heck knows note frequencies???
You know I always have your best interests at heart, and if you 
check out Appendix 1, you will find a table of note frequencies.  
Better yet is Appendix 2, which gives a program in BASIC which 
does the whole calculation for you.  You don't even have to mess 
with frequencies - just tell it the note you want.  

<P> <B>Example:</B>  You are experimenting with higher tension on string 3 only.  
Your set of normal tension strings has the <B>G string</B> sized for a 
tension of 5.49 kg (see footnote 3) and you wonder what 6.0 kg would 
sound and feel like.  Your guitar has a .650m scale length.  The 
frequency of the G is 196 cps.  Plugging everything in yields 
MPL = 0.91 grams/meter.  That will give you a G note at the 
tension you want - regardless of the string composition: nylon, 
wound, gut, steel . . .

<P> <B>Example:</B>  You want to tune the pair of 5th strings on your 
<B>Baroque guitar</B> to the upper octave (220 hz) and you only 
want 3 Kg of tension per string, for a total of 6 Kg for the 
pair.  Suppose the string length is .650m.  Plugging everything 
in yields MPL = 0.36 grams/meter for each string.

<P> <B>Example:</B>  For playing John Dowland, you need a low B for your 
<B>8-string guitar</B>.  You think 6.33 kg will be a good tension.  
Plugging in LENG=.650, FREQ=61.7 and TENS=6.33 yields MPL=9.63 g/m.

<P><B>Summary:</B>

<P> Summing up, I implore all string makers to supply the 
<B>MPL</B> measurement for all of their strings.  I propose that 
<B>grams per meter</B> is a convenient unit for MPL.  

<P> It would be nice to see guitarists get enthused about the 
alternatives to the regular guitar tuning.  This would incidentally 
create an incentive for string makers to offer individual strings 
spanning the whole gamut of MPL densities.

<P><B> 
Footnote 1.  Deriving the formula for MPL.
</B>

<P> The constant 9800 which seems to pop up out of nowhere comes about 
in the conversion of natural physical units into units we 
are more comfortable with.  A kilogram is actually a unit of mass, but 
is used in this context as a unit of force - specifically, the 
<I>weight</I> of a 1-kg mass at sea level, or, equivalently, the 
<I>tension</I> in a string with a 1-kg mass hanging from it.  (Weight 
and tension are both forces.)  

<P> The conversion of tension from proper units of newtons to 
units of "kilograms" is gotten from the relationship, 
<PRE>

      TENS newtons = MASS kg x grav
</PRE>

<P> where grav = 9.8 m/sec/sec, the acceleration due to gravity.  The 
units all cancel out leaving, 
<PRE>

      TENS = 9.8 MASS  
</PRE>

<P> This substitution is made while solving for MPL, BUT . . . after the 
substitution is made we rename MASS back to TENS.  Got it?  (Wouldn't 
it have made more sense to have gotten comfortable with the distinction 
between mass and force from pre-school on?  After all, they're totally 
different beasts.)  

<P> The extra 
factors of 10 arise from the conversion of MPL in units of kg/m to g/m.

Footnote 2.  The old-fashioned string calculation: gauge (= diameter).
</B>

<P> Toyohiko Satoh, in his article "A Method For Stringing Lutes", 
Journal of the Lute Society of America, Vol II, 1969, p44, 
gives a formula devised by Dr. Helmut Herminghaus:
<PRE>

      DIAM = CONST x sqrt(TENS)/FREQ/LENG
</PRE>

<P> where DIAM is the string diameter in mm, and CONST is some 
constant which depends on the material of the string.  The article 
gives two values: CONST=49 for gut strings, and CONST=54 for
nylon strings.  

<P> Note that this equation is in agreement with ours.  The diameter of 
the string and the mass per unit length are related as follows:
<PRE>

      MPL = DENS x PI x DIAM x DIAM / 4
</PRE>

<P> where DENS is the ordinary density (mass per unit volume) 
of the string material, and PI = 3.14159 (approx.)  Substituting 
for MPL in our equation yields
<PRE>

      CONST = sqrt(9800/PI/DENS)
</PRE>

<P> where DENS is in units of g/m/mm/mm (grams per meter per millimeter 
squared.)  It can be seen that the Herminghaus equation requires a 
different constant for every density of string material.  Worse yet, 
<I>no</I> CONST will work for a family of wound strings since the 
density would not be the same for different gauges.

<P> Still, string manufacturers only provide string diameters so that's what 
you must work with (unless you have a triple beam balance and string 
samples.)  Appendix 3 gives a computer program that calculates 
desired string diameters.  

</P><A NAME="fn3"></A><HR>
<P><B> 
Footnote 3.  A typical set of strings.
</B>

<P> A set of values for the tension of normal tension 
guitar strings is given on D'Addario Pro Arte J45 string envelopes.  
They used a .648m scale length.  The tensions and diameters are:
<PRE>

      String     Tension     Diameter
      ------     -------     --------
      1st, E     6.94 kg     0.71 mm
      2nd, B     5.26 kg     0.82 mm
      3rd, G     5.49 kg     1.02 mm
      4th, D     7.09 kg     0.74 mm
      5th, A     6.29 kg     0.86 mm
      6th, E     6.33 kg     1.09 mm
</PRE>

<P> Does anybody know the reason for the variation in tension from string to 
string?  It seems likely that, given the chance, many guitarists would want 
to be in control of the tension of each string.

<P> By the way, the information provided by D'Addario allows us to 
calculate the constant in the Herminghaus equation (see footnote 2) 
for the nylon used in D'Addario monofilament strings.  It works out 
to about 57.  Herminghaus provided a constant of 54 for nylon strings.  
I don't know the reason for the discrepancy.

Appendix 1 - Frequencies of the notes
</B></CENTER>

<P> Pitch names are a pain in the neck.  The A notes named below 
(A, A a a') which start the octaves indicate the <I>actual</I> pitch - 
as opposed to the notated pitch in guitar music.  Another wrinkle is 
that the subscripts and superscripts change at each occurrence of <I>C</I> - 
not A.  

<P> But you can safely ignore all that.  To orient yourself, note that 
the six open guitar string notes are labeled with the 
string number in parentheses.  

<P> To get the frequency of the next lower octave of a note, just 
divide by 2.
